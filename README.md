<h2>🛠️ Technologies Used </h2>
PHP: For powerful server-side scripting and handling dynamic web pages. <br>
MySQL: As the efficient and reliable database management system. <br>
HTML: For building the structure and content of the web pages. <br>
CSS: To style and visually enhance the user interface. <br>
JavaScript: For interactive elements and client-side functionality. <br>

<h2>🏗️ System Architecture</h2>
The Student Management System follows a client-server architecture. The frontend is carefully crafted using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a delightful user experience. On the backend, PHP handles server-side processing, user authentication, and seamless database operations. MySQL serves as the database management system to store and retrieve user data efficiently. <br>

tbl_signup: Used for user authentication data. <br>
tbl_traineeinfo: Stores user information details. <br>
tbl_fdbk: Stores user feedback data. <br>

<h2>🛠️ Installation</h2>
